ðŸ‘‹ I'm Davide Lavermicocca, 22 y/0, Italian Telegram specialist and wanna-be programmer.

## Developer
Currently working to become a back-end developer and hopefully one day a full-stack developer.
I'm confident coding in **Go** and **Python** but I had some experience also with JavaScript (I also took the [freeCodeCamp certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dazfather) on it), C and Java.
You can find my most of my front-end works on my [CodePen profile](https://codepen.io/DazFather).

## Organizations
- Member and contributor of [URL Rete Libera](https://github.com/URL-Rete-Libera)
- Admin of InsideTelegram __(even though at the moment I'm not really active)__
