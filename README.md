ðŸ‘‹ I'm Davide Lavermicocca, 22 y/0, Italian Telegram specialist and wanna-be programmer.

## Developer
Currently working to become a back-end developer and hopefully one day a full-stack developer.
I'm confident coding in **Go** and **Python** but I had some experience also with JavaScript (I also took the [freeCodeCamp certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dazfather) on it), Php, C and Java.

## My Projects
You can find in the repository section some back-end project, while most of my front-end works on my [CodePen profile](https://codepen.io/DazFather).
**Worth to mention:**
- [DazSpaceCMS](https://github.com/DazFather/DazSpaceCMS) - a pure golang server and content management system
- [Snake on Grid](https://codepen.io/DazFather/pen/rNzWWzv) - a playable snake on a game-boy loocking site made in pure vanilla (only HTML, CSS ECMAScript)

## Organizations
- Member and contributor of [URL Rete Libera](https://github.com/URL-Rete-Libera)
- Admin of [InsideTelegram](https://t.me/insidetelegram) _(even though at the moment I'm not really active)_

## Articles
I sometimes write some articles. You can find the most important (and coding-related) on my site: https://DazSpace.codes
